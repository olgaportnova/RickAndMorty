## RickAndMorty
This Android application allows users to explore the world of Rick and Morty, a popular animated TV series. 
It utilizes the public Rick and Morty API to fetch information about characters, episodes, and locations. 
The app also incorporates a Room Database to store fetched data locally, ensuring a seamless user experience even without an internet connection.

#### The application follows the MVVM clean architecture pattern and integrates the following libraries:
* Room Database
* Dependency Injection with Koin
* Paging 3
* Glide for image loading
* Retrofit for networking
* Kotlin Coroutines for asynchronous tasks

Additionally, the app incorporates features such as pull-to-refresh, a single activity pattern, a splash screen, and navigation using a navigation graph. 
It provides functionality for searching by typing and filtering by categories.

Each section (locations, episodes, characters) can be viewed on the screen with a list of items, where search functionality is available, and a detailed screen for individual items.
